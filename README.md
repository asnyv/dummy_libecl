DO NOT USE UNLESS STRICTLY NECESSARY. This is made to avoid building the real libecl for Windows. A dummy package to be able to import fmu-ensemble without having libecl.

## Dummy libecl
**NOTE** This is not `libecl`, just a dummy designed to avoid issues at import of `fmu-ensemble`, e.g. when using `Windows` where `libecl` cannot be installed through `PyPi`. This repository is temporary, and will at some point be deleted without any warning. 

## How to use:
Install this repository locally: `pip install git+https://github.com/equinor/dummy_libecl`
